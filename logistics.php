              <a href="maps.html"><font color="#FF00BF">Click here for Oahu and Waimanalo maps</font></a><font color="#FF00BF">.</font> <br>
          <li>Where do I stay?
              <ul>
                <li>Free camping is provided just across the streets from the fields at Waimanalo Bay Beach Park for Friday through Monday evenings. By state law, all campsites are closed on Wednesday and Thursday nights. There is no camping directly on the beach. Campsites have running water, restrooms, and cold showers. Check back closer to the tournament for more detailed camping information. </li>
              </ul>
          </li>
		</ul>		
		<ul>
          <li>How do I get there?
              <ul>
                <li>By Plane:&nbsp; Fly into Honolulu International Airport (HNL). Just about every major airline serves HNL. </li>
              </ul>
          </li>
	    </ul>
		<ul>
          <ul>
            <li>From the airport, Waikiki, or anywhere in Honoluluget on H1 East. Take it until it ends! H1 turns into Kalanianaole Highway, which passes by Hawaii Kai, Hanauma Bay, Sandy Beach, Sea Life Park, and through Waimanalo. When you see the McDonald's on your right, in Waimanalo, you've got less than a half-mile to go. The fields will be on your left; camping is at Waimanalo Bay Beach Park, on your right. </li>
          </ul>
	    </ul>
		<ul>
          <ul>
            <li>From the airportget on bus 19 or 20 heading towards Waikiki Beach. Get off at Hotel and Alakea. Cross Hotel Street, walk up Alakea a few meters (by the District Court House) and transfer to bus 57 heading towards Kailua/Sea Life Park. The bus ride is 30 minutes to an hour after you transfer, so be patient! Get off at the bus stop right outside of the Waimanalo Polo Fields/ Waimanalo Beach Recreation Area. Officially, no luggage is allowed on the bus, so pack light! From Waikikicatch bus 58 heading towards Hawaii Kai/Sea Life Park from any of a number of bus stops on Kuhio Avenue. After a long (45 min or so) ride, get off in Waimanalo at the bus stop right outside of the Waimanalo Polo Fields/ Waimanalo Beach Recreation Area. Bus rides are $2 one way. </li>
          </ul>
	    </ul>
		<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
		<ul>
		  <li> Cause it's the most fun you've ever had at a tournament.
</ul>
